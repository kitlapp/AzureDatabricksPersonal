Note that Microsoft accepts multiple emails using the same first and last name. Complete the microsoft account creation.\n",

Choose France Central if you are in Greece. Germany West Central didn't have available nodes. According to the instructor, UK South will work as well but I didn't try this. Also pick the premium package of Azure Databricks.\n",
